# Performing post-processing analysis using Qibocal

Let's consider the following output generated by `qq acquire`:

```sh
    resonator_dep/
        data/
            resonator flux dependence_0/
                data.json
                data.npz
        platform/
            parameters.yml
        runcard.yml
        meta.json
        index.html
```
`resonator_dep` contains data acquired for testing the dependence of the resonator on the external flux.

We can perform a post-processing on this data to extract
useful parameters to calibrate our chip.

We can do this by running `qq fit`:

```sh
qq fit resonator_dep
```

Then we can directly update the HTML

```sh
qq report resonator_dep
```

By checking the output folder we can see that we have two new entries:

- `new_platform`: folder with updated platform configuration
- `results.json`: fitting data
